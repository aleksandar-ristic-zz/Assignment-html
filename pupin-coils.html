        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the<br>
            physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the<br>
            patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him<br>
            wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in<br>
            hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid<br>
            they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of<br>
            long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
