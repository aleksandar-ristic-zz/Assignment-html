        <h1>Early life and education</h1>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
         <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of<br>
            Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always remembered the words of his mother<br>
            and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):</p>
         <p>“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide<br>
            yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning in<br>
            the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven;<br>
            knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”</p>
         <p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary school in Perlez.<br>
            He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; a local<br>
            archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.</p>
         <p>Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian police<br>
            authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first half of the seventh<br>
            year.After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial<br>
            problems and to move to the United States.</p>
         <p>“When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars,<br>
            instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have been the same. A young<br>
            immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with him. I brought<br>
            five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing<br>
            but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus<br>
            things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land<br>
            here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he<br>
            has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”</p>
        <h2>Studies in America and Ph.D</h2>
         <p>For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt<br>
            Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of various<br>
            courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College, where he became known as an<br>
            exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's said that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia<br>
            would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated<br>
            with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.</p>
         <p>He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to<br>
            become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered<br>
            carrier wave detection and current analysis.</p>
         <p>Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave<br>
            him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the<br>
            University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the<br>
            United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin<br>
            metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to<br>
            study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison provided Pupin<br>
            with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times,<br>
            from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated<br>
            secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first<br>
            person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to<br>
            obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging<br>
            failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour" which is the time it<br>
            took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the<br>
            patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the<br>
            photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with<br>
            pen and ink." Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>
